## 💡 What is CloudHour?

CloudHour isn’t a webinar or a lecture. It’s a place for **open conversation**, where everyone is encouraged to join in - whether you want to ask questions, share lessons learned, or simply listen and learn.

Each session focuses on a few key topics, such as:
- Microsoft 365 & Intune  
- Azure security & governance  
- Identity, compliance, and zero-trust principles  
- Community-driven insights and tooling  

We keep it real, practical, **no marketing, no sales pitches**, just shared learning and collaboration.
